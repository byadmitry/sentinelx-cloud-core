"""A large capabilities detail=full arrives trimmed, not as a bare note.

sxrep_W0RW3FVD97RJ / sxrep_95SMJC6TJ0CE: a host with ~400 services got
'result omitted: too large to bound field-wise' (166 KB -> 308 bytes). The bulk
of a real capabilities response is in dicts keyed by name (services, playbooks,
locations), which protocol 1.13.1 still could not trim. This builds the response
with the real handler and a large policy, then bounds it as the agent does.
