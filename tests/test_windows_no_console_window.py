"""Nothing we spawn should paint a window on the operator's desktop.

On Windows a console application launched from a process with no console of
its own gets a new one allocated, and that console comes with a VISIBLE
window. The agent runs as a service or from a pythonw scheduled task, so it
has no console: every child briefly flashed a black box. An operator counted
several in a row during ordinary work and traced it to the spawn sites.

CREATE_NO_WINDOW was applied in exactly one handler and nowhere else -- which
is what happens when the knowledge lives in one file's comments instead of in
a shared helper. Hence winspawn, and hence this test walking every spawn site
rather than trusting that the next one will remember.
